This is a repository for Advanced Robot Control laboratory classes 
at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

To read more about the course go to [Course Web Site](https://edu.domski.pl/kursy/advanced-robot-control/)

The ARClab repository is divided into separate directories. 
Each directory contains materials necessary for laboratory classes.

# Table of content:

- **3RMatlab** is a set of scripts written in Matlab for 3R rigid manipulator. 
The goal of this class it to implement input-output decoupling for 
this object. The simulation is run using ODE solver instead of a 
Simulink diagram.

- **GPIO** contains two exercises for STM32 MCU. Those 
exercises involve GPIO manipulation using a button to read 
data from digital input, and a LED to write digital output.
